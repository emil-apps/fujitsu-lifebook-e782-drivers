 Precautions
===================================================================

 - When starting Windows after changing display settings or
   displaying screen saver, there are no Hotkey indicators with Hot
   Keys (Fn+F3,F4,F6, F7,F8,F9) operation; however, the Hot Keys
   will still function.

 - When Windows is activated under administrative privileges, audio
   volume indicator does not appear. Even when that is the case, the
   condition of the screen brightness, audio volume, or built-in
   pointing device conditions can be changed. 

 - Indicator may appear behind another window, depending upon the
   system condition. If that occurs, reboot the system.  
 
 - While the indicator is displayed in only 26 different levels, the
   audio volume controlled by a keyboard or remote control has 100
   levels. As a result, the indicator may not show a level change in
   response to every change made by the keyboard or remote control.
